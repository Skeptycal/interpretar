# interpretar

Define set of macros and functions, write some declarative statements in XML and
let the interpreter do the job.
The example usage scenario are: defining UI in declerative manner, writing validation logic,
writing factories, defining actors logic.
Implementation is light and standard enought to be used in JME or GWT environment.
The difference between macro and function is the arguments evaluation moment. In the first case the arguments
are evaluated explicite by author of the macro, in the second case the arguments are evaluated implicite before
calling function.
